## ✨ About The Project

This Pomodoro Timer is a simple yet effective tool to help you manage your time and stay focused on your tasks 🎯. It's built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a clean, aesthetic design that is easy on the eyes.

Whether you're studying for exams 📚, working on a big project 💼, or just trying to manage your daily tasks, this timer is your perfect productivity partner.
